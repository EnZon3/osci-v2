# osci-v2

tryna make a better version of the shitty vibecoded oscilloscope i (ai) made in p5js a couple years ago

this is the first time i'm using sdl at all so don't bully me too hard

made this in about a day

## important info

## todo

- [x] make it actually work
- [ ] refactor stuff so it doesn't look like a mess
- [x] make it customizable (i'll mark this half off because it is customizable but not in a good way)
- [x] figure out conditions for audio end
- [ ] support different bit depths (currently only 32-bit enc supported)
- [ ] optimize the shit out of this

## problems

- color doesnt fade completely to black which is infuriating
